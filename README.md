# BayesTTA: Continual-Temporal Test-Time Adaptation for Vision-Language Models via Gaussian Discriminant Analysis

This repository contains the official implementation of **BayesTTA**, a principled Bayesian adaptation framework designed for continual-temporal test-time adaptation (CT-TTA) of vision-language models (VLMs). BayesTTA incrementally estimates class-conditional Gaussian distributions, adaptively determines covariance structures via hypothesis testing, and performs calibrated inference through Gaussian discriminant analysis (GDA).
